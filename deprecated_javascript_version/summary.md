# deprecated_javascript_version Summary

- Archived reference implementation of the older JavaScript-based proxy.
- Includes a `server.cjs` Fastify/Express-style bridge, `auto_connect_aistudio.cjs` automation helpers, small `test.js` harness, and the original `package.json` manifest.
- README documents why the JS port is no longer maintained; kept mainly for historical context or advanced users who want to compare implementations.
